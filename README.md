# üìö Chatbot Content Pipeline

This repository powers a personal AI assistant that can chat with recruiters and hiring managers about your resume and background. It uses OpenAI embeddings, a Supabase vector store, and a GitHub-managed content pipeline to enable semantic search and intelligent chatbot conversations.

---

## üöÄ Purpose

This repo enables:
- A chatbot to answer questions like ‚ÄúDoes Sara have experience in X?‚Äù
- Semantically searching resume content stored as markdown
- Keeping a vector database in sync with your markdown updates via GitHub actions or manual syncs

---

## üß± Structure

### `resume-blurbs.md`
The source of truth. All experience is written here in markdown using level-2 headings (`##`) for sections.

### `scripts/`
Contains utility scripts:
- `sync-resume-blurbs.ts` ‚Äì Reads `resume-blurbs.md`, generates embeddings, syncs them to Supabase with deduplication and cleanup
- `test-semantic-search.ts` ‚Äì Tests how a query matches stored vectors
- `test-openai.ts` ‚Äì Validates OpenAI key and embedding access

### `supabase/`
Contains Supabase schema and migrations:
- `migrations/` ‚Äì SQL migrations for creating the `vectors` table and `match_vectors` function

---

## üß™ Testing the Pipeline

To run the sync process:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/sync-resume-blurbs.ts
```

To test semantic search:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-semantic-search.ts
```

---

## üõ† Prerequisites

Create a `.env` file in the root with:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-key
```

---

## üß† Semantic Search SQL Function

Supabase includes a `match_vectors` function that finds similar content using cosine distance. See:
```
supabase/migrations/20250518145240_add-match-vectors-function.sql
```

---

## üîÅ Updates

Any changes to `resume-blurbs.md` should be followed by a sync using the script. GitHub Actions can automate this using a webhook.

---

## üí¨ Example Use Case

A recruiter asks:
> "Does Sara have experience with GTM or pricing?"

The chatbot:
- Embeds the question
- Runs `match_vectors`
- Returns top relevant chunks from your resume

---

## üìé TODO

- [ ] Add GitHub Actions integration for auto-sync
- [ ] Integrate into production chatbot (e.g., Vercel API route)
- [ ] Add CLI to customize sync/test behavior
